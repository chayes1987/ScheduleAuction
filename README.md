# Schedule Auction

This is the scheduler service for my FYP. It is written in Python. It uses APScheduler for scheduling and also connects to a MongoDB database. It is responsible for scheduling auctions based on their start time.

## Project Setup

Requires a MongoDB daemon running on port 27017 with the correct database and collection.
